This application demonstrates the use of APEX2 LBP classifier. 
The demo loads an RGB input image, transforms it to grayscale, 
executes the classifier, marks the faces as green rectangles and outputs the resulting RGB image. 
The classifier is implemented both in ACF and on the host processor. 
The applications outputs 3 images: faces found by APEX, faces found by the OpenCV 
library and faces found by a custom host CPU fixed-point implementation.
The project contains the configuration to run the application on Linux (A53).

APEX debugging: 
The provided breakpoint "apu_hal_Enable" is disabled by default, 
it should be enabled to debug APEX code via S32 Debugger.
Due to a known issue with the version of Eclipse CDT with which S32 Design Studio is integrated, 
it will require some extra steps to properly enable the provided breakpoint "apu_hal_Enable".
Click to check the box, click again to uncheck the box, then click a 3rd time to again check the box.
Execute "Resume" command twice.
Start APEX debugging after the breakpoint is reached at the second time.
Breakpoints at <graph_name> functions are set by default.
The execution is in "runnning" state on APEX debugging thread.
Execute "Resume" command on A53 application.
The execution stops on  <graph_name> breakpoint on APEX debugging thread.
Start APEX debugging.

Requirements:  
S32V234 board with Linux.
